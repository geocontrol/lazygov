# Lazygov - make a change by wanting to
***

The LazyGov project is a way to track and find the ways that you can make a change on the political landscape.

## The UnParty UnConference
***

Discuss ideas in a non-partisan, collaborative environment. Hold local meetings and invite everyone along who wants to take part. These can be roound table discussions, general chats or more 'formal' structures. 

We held the first UnParty UnConference at the Open Data Institute, London on the 4th December 2013.

## A New Politics
***

Take part in thinking about and creating a new politics, the Open Politics Project (http://www.openpolitics.org.uk) is currently trying to crowdsource a Manifesto.


## Crowdsourcing policy ideas to live by

***

Lazygov was originally launched in 2003 at Lazygov.org. It was based on the LazyWeb code written by Ben Hammersley from an original idea by Matt Jones.
When it was launched we were not sure what the problem was that we wanted to address. Initially we thought that it would be good to get policy ideas and critique these ideas and the role of governance.
At the time, we were told, there were no shortage of ideas. What was needed were tools, online services etc.
At the time we were on the cusp of TheyWorkForYou.com, MySociety.org and similar. 
In many ways we doubt that much has changed but, with Occupy, with the experiments that have happened in Iceland, the formation of the Pirate Party there does appear to be a vacuum for ideas.
It may be that we still have plenty of ideas, just not the space to discuss and join and critique them.
We are re-launching LazyGov as an experiment. Part of the LazyGov site will be a way to reflect these ideas in a way that makes them quick to find and join up and discuss.

The old model, using trackback is not really one that will deliver on connectivity today. 
Today we will use the following:
* Search for the hashtag lazygov
* Search for the URL lazygov

Each post with either will be found via search engines etc. A unique hash can be created to fingerprint the post / message.

A part of the post or the message will be displayed on the LazyGov page, together with the link to the original post.
