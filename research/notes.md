## Definition of the problem
The aim of the LazyGov project is to examine collaboration and participation in politics by a much broader part of the population on a more engaged and often time frame than just the particiaption in a general election. 

Specifically I am interested in the ideas around the crowd-sourcing of Policy and how this can work. 

Initially to help gather information for the project I have initiated the following:

* The UnParty UnConference. This is the creation of events that are set up and open to the public and are not party driven. The aim is to create an inclusive space that anyone can contribute to.
* The Policy Notebook. Using Bookleteer I have produced an initial idea behind a Policy Notebook, a paper booklet that is designed to be used in the initial thinking and shaping of a policy idea. It has a set of prompts thoughout the book that should encourage the author to exmaine the idea that they have created.

To try and make Policy feel closer to the public and less about Westminster we need to look at the ideas currently used to develop poicy as well as ideas from other areas that are used to test proposals. So areas for examination include:

* Consultations, both public and professional
* Lobbying. How this works, what is involved and who is involved, what are the advantages and the problems with the Lobbying system.
* Policy as Case Law. As in Case Law could Policy be created with an over all set of guidelines and then recorded case studies on implementation and review that can inform the future implementation and evolution of the policy.
* Policy GitHub. See the Open Politics Project, but by having policy in a change controlled repository it becomes easier to see how policy can evolve, be updated and 'fixed' in the same way code does.
* User Stories. Can you, as the author of a policy idea write a user story for your idea.


## Background

## Notes

### Background Reading - Power, crowds and politics

* Foucault

### Ballot Paper Designs
 
The design of the communication around voting is very important, what is coded into the visual language used, what assumptions are made of those who are taking part in the democratic process.

### Protest Placards & Art & Design

Is there an archive of protest banners?


* http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/mark-wallinger-state-britain - Mark Wallinger recreated Brian Haw's anti-iraq war protest inside Tate Britain (which was still, just, within the exclusion zone for protest outside parliament).
